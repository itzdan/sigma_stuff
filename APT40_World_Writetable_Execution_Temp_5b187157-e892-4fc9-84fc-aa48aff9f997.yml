Title: World Writable Execution - Temp

ID: d2fa2d71-fbd0-4778-9449-e13ca7d7505c

Description: Detect process execution from C:\Windows\Temp.

Background:

This rule looks specifically for execution out of C:\Windows\Temp\*. Temp is more broadly used by benign applications and thus a lower confidence malicious indicator than execution out of other world writable subdirectories in C:\Windows.

Removing applications executed by the SYSTEM or NETWORK SERVICE users substantially reduces the quantity of benign activity selected by this rule.

This means that the rule may miss malicious executions at a higher privilege level but it is recommended to use other rules to determine if a user is attempting to elevate privileges to SYSTEM.

Investigation:
Examine information directly associated with this file execution, such as the user context, execution integrity level, immediate follow-on activity and images loaded by the file.
Investigate contextual process, network, file and other supporting data on the host to help make an assessment as to whether the activity is malicious.
If necessary attempt to collect a copy of the file for reverse engineering to determine whether it is legitimate.

    condition: temp and not (common_temp_path or system_user or dismhost or known_parent)

False Positives:
Allowlist auditing applications have been observed running executables from Temp.
Temp will legitimately contain an array of setup applications and launchers, so it will be worth considering how prevalent this behaviour is on a monitored network (and whether or not it can be allowlisted) before deploying this rule.
Level: low
