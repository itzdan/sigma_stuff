Title: World Writable Execution - Users

ID: 6dda3843-182a-4214-9263-925a80b4c634

Description: Detect process execution from C:\Users\Public\* and other world writable folders within Users.

Background:

AppData folders are excluded if a file is run as SYSTEM - this is a benign way in which many temporary application files are executed.

Investigation:

Examine information directly associated with this file execution, such as the user context, execution integrity level, immediate follow-on activity and images loaded by the file.
Investigate contextual process, network, file and other supporting data on the host to help make an assessment as to whether the activity is malicious.
If necessary attempt to collect a copy of the file for reverse engineering to determine whether it is legitimate.

It is plausible that scripts and administrative tools used in the monitored environment(s) may be located in Public or a subdirectory and should be addressed on a case-by-case basis.
